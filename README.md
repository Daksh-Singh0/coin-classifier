# coin-counter

This program counts coin change (quarter, nickel, or dime) for a bank by using a picture taken of coins placed on a countertop from a camera placed above the bank teller's countertop. When someone spreads any combination of quarters, nickels, and dimes on the countertop, the program will analyze the image taken from the camera to: (1) localize the coins, (2) classify each coin as a quarter, nickel, or dime, (3) add up the total value of the coins in the image.
